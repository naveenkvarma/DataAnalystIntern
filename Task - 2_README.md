- Between 2011 and 2014, the company achieved Total Sales of $3 million and Total Profit of $400.9K.
- In 2014 alone, the business generated over $1 million in sales and earned $119.11K in profit.
- The Technology category accounted for a significant portion of profitability, contributing approximately 46% of the total profit.
- While March and April of 2014 saw peak sales revenue, December, despite being the holiday season, recorded the lowest sales performance.
- Applying filters for Year: 2014, Category: Technology, and Order Priority: Medium provides focused insights into one of the most profitable product segments.
